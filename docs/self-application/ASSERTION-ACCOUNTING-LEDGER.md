# Assertion-accounting ledger — total accounting over sugar's own Rust tree

The companion axis to [`GOAL-sugar-proves-sugar.md`](./GOAL-sugar-proves-sugar.md).
That doc tracks **K** (panic-safe call sites discharged via sound reasoning,
measured by `sugar self-check` with the rust-analyzer oracle). This ledger
tracks the other half of "sugar proves sugar": the **lift homomorphism's total
accounting** — of every assertion in sugar's own test surface, how many lift to
FOL, how many are refused **by name**, and how many are **silently dropped**.

The hard invariant is the same one the whole product rests on: **silent = 0,
structurally.** Every `assert*` macro is either lifted to a FOL contract or
refused with a named reason; none vanishes.

## Recompute it yourself (no oracle, pure source)

```
cargo build -p sugar-lift-rust-tests --bin coretests_sweep
for c in libsugar sugar-ir-compiler-smt-lib sugar-cli sugar-verifier sugar-walk; do
  ./implementations/rust/target/debug/coretests_sweep \
    implementations/rust/$c/src --json /tmp/sweep-$c.json
done
```

`unaccounted (net)` mixes two signs; the load-bearing number is
`genuinely unreached (SILENT)` — a positive per-file residual, the true silent
drop. A negative residual is *inlining inflation* (one textual assert lifted as
several point-wise instances because a helper was inlined at N call sites), not
a drop. The sweep separates them.

The multiset CID pins the assertion *surface*: a count-preserving swap still
moves the CID, so a silent regression cannot hide behind an unchanged total.

## The 432 named-refused, decomposed (the bin-1 burndown)

The construction-semantics axiom ([[project_provekit_construction_semantics_axiom]])
sorts every refusal into **bin-1** (constructed from literals, but the walker
doesn't speak that constructor yet — *drains*) or **bin-2** (never constructed
by the source — IO/clock/allocator, or here, procedural meta-test scaffolding —
*named, never proved*).

| category | count | bin | meaning / drain path |
|---|---:|---|---|
| **drainable term-shape** | 165 | bin-1 | `only scalar equality is liftable` (72), `unsupported term` (91). Teach the assertion lifter structural/componentwise equality and the missing term shapes. |
| **control-flow-released** | 115 | bin-1 | `assertion under for/if/match context … released to later pass` (88), `unenumerated statement position` (27). Drains when the loop/conditional assertion pass matures. |
| **temporal identity** | 81 | bin-1/bin-2 edge | `ambiguous temporal identity for receiver` — a mutated receiver has no value allocated-at-formation. SSA/guard-lifter tracking drains the stabilizable ones; genuinely mutated state is bin-2 by the allocation axiom. |
| **meta-test scaffolding** | 71 | bin-2 | sugar's own `assert_panic_locus_lines`, `assert_*_fails_closed`, `assert_kit_declaration_mappings`, etc. — procedural tests of the tooling itself, asserting about lift internals, not value constructions. Never FOL; named forever. |

**The single tracking number for this axis: drainable bin-1 = 280** (term-shape
165 + control-flow-released 115), with 81 on the temporal edge to be
adjudicated per the allocation axiom, and 71 honest structural bin-2.
**silent = 0 (hard invariant, held).** Drive drainable bin-1 → 0.

## Drain order (M3 worklist)

1. **Structural equality** — `only scalar equality is liftable` (72): lift
   `assert_eq!(a, b)` where `a`/`b` are structs / tuples / collections as
   componentwise equality, not just scalars. Biggest single bucket.
2. **Unsupported term shapes** (91): enumerate the distinct `unsupported term`
   shapes (`reason_samples` in the JSON ledger) and teach them one family per
   slice (the convergence pattern — each slice teaches one constructor).
3. **Control-flow-released** (115): the loop/conditional assertion pass picks up
   `for`/`if`/`match`-bound assertions as guarded point-wise rows.
4. **Temporal identity** (81): apply the guard-lifter SSA discipline
   ([[project_provekit_guard_lifter_soundness_pattern]]) to stabilize
   non-mutated receivers; name the genuinely-mutated remainder as bin-2.

Each slice updates this table with the new number and a one-line why, exactly as
`GOAL-sugar-proves-sugar.md` requires for K.

## Drain log

- **`matches!` discriminant lift** (slice 1, base main `4221ec1d1`): lift
  `assert!(matches!(x, Type::Variant ...))` as the construction-semantics
  discriminant atom `variant_of(x) == "variant::<tag>"` — the SAME atom
  panic-locus lifting emits, same teeth (two variants = two distinct string
  constants ⇒ UNSAT). Guards and binding / single-segment / or-patterns are
  **refused by precise name** (their discriminant is not unambiguous). Result
  over the 5 crates: lift **85.9% → 87.2%**; `only scalar equality is liftable`
  **72 → 10**; the unsound `matches!` shapes now read
  `matches! … not an unambiguous qualified variant` (15) and
  `matches! with a guard is not a pure discriminant` (13). **silent = 0** held.
  Negation (`!matches!`) fixed too: it previously fell to an opaque `macro:…`
  Var (a vacuous lift, no teeth); now lifts the negated discriminant.

- **struct-literal equality** (slice 2, base main `978c4996c`): give
  `translate_term_in_scope` an `Expr::Struct` arm so `assert_eq!(x, Type { f: v })`
  lifts the RHS as a Ctor `struct:<Path>` with one `field:<name>` sub-ctor per
  field, **sorted by name** (source field order irrelevant → canonical term) and
  field names significant. Distinct literals are distinct Ctors ⇒ asserting the
  wrong one is UNSAT (teeth). `..rest` is **refused by name** (value not fully
  pinned from the literal); an untranslatable field propagates its own named Err.
  Result over the 5 crates: lift **87.2% → 87.8%** (+16 lifted, −16 refused);
  `assert_eq!: unsupported term` **42 → 29**. **silent = 0** held.
