# Assertion-accounting ledger — total accounting over sugar's own tree

The companion axis to [`GOAL-sugar-proves-sugar.md`](./GOAL-sugar-proves-sugar.md).
That doc tracks **K** (panic-safe call sites discharged via sound reasoning,
measured by `sugar self-check` with the rust-analyzer oracle). This ledger
tracks the other half of "sugar proves sugar": the **lift homomorphism's total
accounting** — of every assertion in sugar's own test surface, how many lift to
FOL, how many are refused **by name**, and how many are **silently dropped**.

The hard invariant is the same one the whole product rests on: **silent = 0,
structurally.** Every `assert*` macro is either lifted to a FOL contract or
refused with a named reason; none vanishes.

## Recompute it yourself (no oracle, pure source)

```
cargo build -p sugar-lift-rust-tests --bin coretests_sweep
for c in libsugar sugar-ir-compiler-smt-lib sugar-cli sugar-verifier sugar-walk; do
  ./implementations/rust/target/debug/coretests_sweep \
    implementations/rust/$c/src --json /tmp/sweep-$c.json
done
```

`unaccounted (net)` mixes two signs; the load-bearing number is
`genuinely unreached (SILENT)` — a positive per-file residual, the true silent
drop. A negative residual is *inlining inflation* (one textual assert lifted as
several point-wise instances because a helper was inlined at N call sites), not
a drop. The sweep separates them.

## Opening baseline (main `e15b0ac00`, 2026-06-11)

| **total** | **2659** | **2285 (85.9%)** | **432** | **0** | — |

The multiset CID pins the assertion *surface*: a count-preserving swap still
moves the CID, so a silent regression cannot hide behind an unchanged total.

## The 432 named-refused, decomposed (the bin-1 burndown)

The construction-semantics axiom ([[project_provekit_construction_semantics_axiom]])
sorts every refusal into **bin-1** (constructed from literals, but the walker
doesn't speak that constructor yet — *drains*) or **bin-2** (never constructed
by the source — IO/clock/allocator, or here, procedural meta-test scaffolding —
*named, never proved*).

| category | count | bin | meaning / drain path |
|---|---:|---|---|
| **drainable term-shape** | 165 | bin-1 | `only scalar equality is liftable` (72), `unsupported term` (91). Teach the assertion lifter structural/componentwise equality and the missing term shapes. |
| **control-flow-released** | 115 | bin-1 | `assertion under for/if/match context … released to later pass` (88), `unenumerated statement position` (27). Drains when the loop/conditional assertion pass matures. |
| **temporal identity** | 81 | bin-1/bin-2 edge | `ambiguous temporal identity for receiver` — a mutated receiver has no value allocated-at-formation. SSA/guard-lifter tracking drains the stabilizable ones; genuinely mutated state is bin-2 by the allocation axiom. |
| **meta-test scaffolding** | 71 | bin-2 | sugar's own `assert_panic_locus_lines`, `assert_*_fails_closed`, `assert_kit_declaration_mappings`, etc. — procedural tests of the tooling itself, asserting about lift internals, not value constructions. Never FOL; named forever. |

**The single tracking number for this axis: drainable bin-1 = 280** (term-shape
165 + control-flow-released 115), with 81 on the temporal edge to be
adjudicated per the allocation axiom, and 71 honest structural bin-2.
**silent = 0 (hard invariant, held).** Drive drainable bin-1 → 0.

### Frontier correction (after slices 1–2): the 280 was over-counted

Reading the *actual refused corpus* (the `reason_samples`, not the bucket names)
collapsed the estimate. The two genuinely-cheap families — `matches!`
discriminant and struct-literal equality — are **drained** (slices 1–2). What
remains in the "term-shape" and "control-flow" buckets is **not** cheap bin-1:

- **iterator/closure predicates** (≈the entire residual `unsupported term`
  bucket): `coll.iter().any(|w| w["k"] == lit)`, `.all(|c| c == '0')`,
  `opt.map(|v| v.as_str())`. These quantify (∃/∀) over collections whose contents
  are **opaque runtime data**, not source literals. By the construction axiom,
  ∀-over-non-literal is **bin-2-leaning** — there is no finite construction from
  written literals to walk. Lifting the literal-collection sub-case
  (`for x in [a,b,c]`) is real bin-1 but rare in this corpus; the rest needs
  sound opaque-sorted `forall` encoding (substrate #1717), not a cheap term arm.
- **`for`-context** (83): every sample iterates an **opaque** collection
  (`for row in &report.rows`, `for solver in registry`) — same ∀-over-non-literal
  story. `released to layer 0` is an honest named refusal, not a silent drop.
- **temporal-identity** (81) and **meta-scaffolding** (71): unchanged —
  construction-boundary and bin-2 respectively.

**Honest revised number: cheap drainable bin-1 ≈ 0 remaining on this axis** —
the two clean families are harvested. The residual is (a) quantifier lifting
over opaque collections (hard, soundness-critical, much of it bin-2 by the
axiom), (b) temporal-identity via guard-lifter SSA, (c) bin-2 scaffolding named
forever. **silent = 0 throughout.** This is the expected shape of a converging
burndown: the cheap constructors drain fast, then the frontier is the genuinely
hard (quantifiers) and the genuinely IO/bin-2 (the membrane) — exactly the two
things the goal says should be all that's left.

### Next phase (the fork)

1. **Quantifier lifting** — sound opaque-sorted `forall`/`exists` over a
   collection term, so `coll.iter().all(|x| P(x))` lifts to `∀x. member(x,coll) → P(x)`
   and the literal-collection case unrolls. The biggest *real* bin-1 left, but
   soundness-critical (do not rush).
2. **Broaden to Python** (the second language) — **DONE** (see the
   [Python section](#python-second-language-value-pin-axis)): the value-pin axis
   is measured (63 candidates, 42 pinned, 21 bin-2, silent = 0). Remaining Python
   build: a plain-`assert` (pytest) lifter — sugar's own Python *test* assertions
   are lifted by no mechanism today.
3. **M1 closedness/vacuity gate** — make the existing `vacuous` label a *hard*
   structural refusal at mint (the precondition for an honest totality claim).

## Drain order (M3 worklist)

1. **Structural equality** — `only scalar equality is liftable` (72): lift
   `assert_eq!(a, b)` where `a`/`b` are structs / tuples / collections as
   componentwise equality, not just scalars. Biggest single bucket.
2. **Unsupported term shapes** (91): enumerate the distinct `unsupported term`
   shapes (`reason_samples` in the JSON ledger) and teach them one family per
   slice (the convergence pattern — each slice teaches one constructor).
3. **Control-flow-released** (115): the loop/conditional assertion pass picks up
   `for`/`if`/`match`-bound assertions as guarded point-wise rows.
4. **Temporal identity** (81): apply the guard-lifter SSA discipline
   ([[project_provekit_guard_lifter_soundness_pattern]]) to stabilize
   non-mutated receivers; name the genuinely-mutated remainder as bin-2.

Each slice updates this table with the new number and a one-line why, exactly as
`GOAL-sugar-proves-sugar.md` requires for K.

> Correction from the corpus read: the `only scalar equality is liftable` (72)
> bucket was **not** struct-`assert_eq!` — it was dominated by
> `assert!(matches!(x, Enum::Variant ..))`, a boolean discriminant assertion.

> remains a later slice under "unsupported term shapes".

## Drain log

- **`matches!` discriminant lift** (slice 1, base main `4221ec1d1`): lift
  `assert!(matches!(x, Type::Variant ...))` as the construction-semantics
  discriminant atom `variant_of(x) == "variant::<tag>"` — the SAME atom
  panic-locus lifting emits, same teeth (two variants = two distinct string
  constants ⇒ UNSAT). Guards and binding / single-segment / or-patterns are
  **refused by precise name** (their discriminant is not unambiguous). Result
  over the 5 crates: lift **85.9% → 87.2%**; `only scalar equality is liftable`
  **72 → 10**; the unsound `matches!` shapes now read
  `matches! … not an unambiguous qualified variant` (15) and
  `matches! with a guard is not a pure discriminant` (13). **silent = 0** held.
  Negation (`!matches!`) fixed too: it previously fell to an opaque `macro:…`
  Var (a vacuous lift, no teeth); now lifts the negated discriminant.

- **struct-literal equality** (slice 2, base main `978c4996c`): give
  `translate_term_in_scope` an `Expr::Struct` arm so `assert_eq!(x, Type { f: v })`
  lifts the RHS as a Ctor `struct:<Path>` with one `field:<name>` sub-ctor per
  field, **sorted by name** (source field order irrelevant → canonical term) and
  field names significant. Distinct literals are distinct Ctors ⇒ asserting the
  wrong one is UNSAT (teeth). `..rest` is **refused by name** (value not fully
  pinned from the literal); an untranslatable field propagates its own named Err.
  Result over the 5 crates: lift **87.2% → 87.8%** (+16 lifted, −16 refused);
  `assert_eq!: unsupported term` **42 → 29**. **silent = 0** held.

## Python (second language) — value-pin axis

Closing the "only Rust measured" gap. Python's self-application does **not** go
through the test-assertion lifter: sugar's own Python tests use plain pytest
`assert`, while `assertion_layer`/`lift_test_file` target a vendor `assert_*`
vocab learned from testing modules (numpy.testing-style) — a different (vendor)
surface. The Python **source** total-accounting mechanism is `value_pins`
(`scan_module_value_pins`), with its own structural floor
(`test_structural_floor.py`: `_unaccounted_grammar() == {}` — silent = 0 by an
exhaustive grammar visit, the same discipline as Rust's `coretests_sweep`).

### Recompute it yourself (no oracle, pure source)

```python
import ast, glob, sys
sys.path.insert(0, "implementations/python/sugar-lift-python-source/src")
from sugar_lift_python_source.value_pins import scan_module_value_pins
c=p=r=0
for root in ["implementations/python/sugar-lift-python-source/src",
             "implementations/python/sugar-lift-py-tests/src"]:
    for path in glob.glob(root+"/**/*.py", recursive=True):
        s = scan_module_value_pins(ast.parse(open(path).read()))
        assert s.totality_holds()          # candidates == pins + refusals (silent = 0)
        c += s.candidates; p += len(s.pins); r += len(s.refusals)
print(c, p, r)   # 63 42 21
```

### Opening baseline (main, 2026-06-11), 40 files

| | candidates | pinned | refused | SILENT |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| sugar Python source | 63 | 42 (66.7%) | 21 | **0** |

`totality_holds()` is **True for every file** — silent = 0 structurally, not
sampled.

### The 21 refused, decomposed — already ~all bin-2

| reason | count | bin |
|---|---:|---|
| `mutable value (dict) cannot pin` | 9 | bin-2 |
| `mutable value (set) cannot pin` | 7 | bin-2 |
| `mutable value (list) cannot pin` | 3 | bin-2 |
| `global declaration in nested scope can rebind` | 2 | bin-2 |

Every refusal is the **construction / allocation axiom in the Python teeth**: a
mutable container (dict/set/list) is not allocated-as-fixed at formation — it can
be mutated after the contract forms — so it is genuinely *not value-pinnable*
(bin-2), exactly as Rust refuses mutated receivers ("ambiguous temporal
identity"). A rebindable global is the binding-time form of the same rule.

**Drainable bin-1 ≈ 0 on this axis too.** The Python value-pin self-accounting
is already at the goal shape: silent = 0, residual = named bin-2 (mutable /
rebindable values that the axiom says cannot be pinned). The open Python gap is
elsewhere — sugar's own pytest `assert` statements are lifted by *no* mechanism
today (the assertion lifter is vendor-vocab-only); a plain-`assert` lifter is the
Python analog of the Rust assertion sweep, and the real next Python build.
